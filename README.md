# Headless Commerce Frontend (Technical MVP)

This project is a headless ecommerce frontend built with Next.js (App Router).

It implements a domain-driven commerce layer with explicit, versioned contracts,
designed to decouple the frontend from any specific ecommerce provider.

## Project Status

This repository represents a **technical MVP** and is intentionally frozen.

It focuses on:
- Clear domain boundaries
- Stable, validated contracts
- Read-only commerce flows (v1)

Domain contracts and invariants are documented in:
`/lib/commerce/contracts`
